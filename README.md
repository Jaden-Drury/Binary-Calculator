### Discussion:
    Division of work
    General plan for the week

    Front end (Chase) (Collin):
        - Create the interface
        - Call the backend functions into the interface
            - Ensure that invalid input is handled
    Backend:
      - Multiplication, with unit tests  (Casey)
      - Division, with unit tests  (Casey)
      - Addition, with unit tests (Jaden)
      - Subtraction, with unit tests (Jaden)
      - Square Root, with unit tests (Chunxiang Yu)
      - Square, with unit tests (Chunxiang Yu)
      - Conversion between decimal and binary, with unit tests (Chunxiang Yu)
          - Sanity test

    - We plan to use distributed git flow for the backend work, and pair programming on the front end.
    - CamelCase and curly braces on the same line as methods {}
    - Descriptive variable names
    - We need to create an initial commit with some java classes that will be what people work out of 
      Operations class with individual methods in it (Casey)
